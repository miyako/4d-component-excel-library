## About 

the component is a cross platform utility that invokes AppleScript on Mac and VBScript on Windows. it offers `193` functions to procedurally control the running Microsoft ExcelÂ® Application.

performance it **very slow** because every command launches the scripting host.

I publish this repository only for archival purposes.
